This project is to exercise my React, Bootstrap (which leads to React-Bootstrap) and Instagram. Further, the general objective of this project is to allow a more meaningful view of how posts are doing, perhaps an analytics, of sorts.

## Todo
- Enable isomorphic features
- Enabled signed Instagram-API requests
- Disable Instagram implicit OAuth
- Add instagram notifications
